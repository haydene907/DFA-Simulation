This project simulates Determinate Finite Automata. It asks for a two character alphabet to use,
asks how many states you want, and then what transitions under what conditions.
Then it will see whether these states are in fact determinate and finite, if so
it allows you to input different strings to see if they are accepted or not.

Further improvements could involve a GUI to more easily demonstrate the layout of the automata.
